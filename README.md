# find_duplicated_class
find duplicated class in jar, aar files (which is in project)

findDuplicated.py is for find duplicated class in project (I used it for Unity Project)

list_class.py is legacy. it makes lists of classes in jar,aar in a folder, find duplicated class in a folder (not work for inner folders)

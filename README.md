# find_duplicated_class
find duplicated class in jar, aar files (which is in project)

findDuplicated.py is for find duplicated class in project (I used it for Unity Project)
list_class.py is legacy, make list of class in jar,aar in folder, find duplicated class in one folder (not work for inner folders)
